### 🧩 About Me

I'm a creative and technically inclined Flutter developer with a strong focus on building responsive, user-centric mobile applications. I enjoy transforming real-world problems into smooth, intuitive app experiences. With hands-on experience in both frontend and backend integration, I design applications that not only look great — but also *work smart*.

From crafting modern UI with Flutter widgets to integrating Firebase, Node.js, and local databases, I enjoy full-cycle development. I thrive on rapid prototyping, clean architecture, and continuously learning to build better products that matter.
